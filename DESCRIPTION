Description: The base R data.frame, like any vector, is
    copied upon modification. This behavior is at odds with
    that of GUIs and interactive graphics. To rectify this,
    plumbr provides a mutable, dynamic tabular data model.
    Models may be chained together to form the complex
    plumbing necessary for sophisticated graphical
    interfaces. Also included is a
    general framework for linking datasets; an typical
    use case would be a linked brush.
