Description: The base R data.frame, like any vector, is copied upon
  modification. This behavior is at odds with that of GUIs and interactive
  graphics. To rectify this, plumbr provides a mutable, dynamic tabular
  data model. Models may be chained together to form the complex
  plumbing necessary for sophisticated graphical interfaces.
